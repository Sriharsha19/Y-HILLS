# Y-HILLS
During my internship at Y-HILLS , I had the opportunity to work on two significant capstone projects that allowed me to apply my data science and machine learning skills to real-world problems.
1. H1N1 Vaccine Prediction :
The main goal of project was to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving their H1N1 flu vaccine. The results of this study have the potential to inform public health professionals and policymakers about factors affecting vaccination rates. We analyzed data from the National Flu Survey and used various machine learning models, including Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighborhood Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and XG Boosting Classifier. Our model's accuracy and precision scores, especially with the Gradient Boosting Classifier, demonstrated the potential to make informed decisions and improve vaccination strategies.

2. New York City Taxi Fare Prediction :
I developed a machine learning model to predict taxi fare amounts in New York City, considering factors beyond just distance, such as traffic patterns and time of day. By refining fare estimates, I aimed to enhance accuracy and provide passengers with more reliable ride costs, contributing to a better overall experience.
